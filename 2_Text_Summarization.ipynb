    "A merchant with three daughters traveled each year to a distant city to collect money. One evening during a terrible storm, while the merchant was away, a beggar came to their house asking for shelter. The eldest daughters, moved by his plea, insisted on letting him in despite their youngest sister’s warning that they should honor their father’s instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "During dinner, the beggar secretly sprinkled sleeping powder on the apples meant for dessert. The two elder sisters ate the apples and fell asleep, but the youngest, suspicious, did not eat hers. Awake and alert, she heard the beggar—revealed to be a robber—go downstairs to unbolt the doors leading to the merchant’s store. Realizing her plan was foiled, the robber chief became furious, and his gang tried in vain to break into the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their efforts and curses, the youngest daughter’s caution and bravery protected the household from harm. Her wisdom proved greater than her sisters’ kindness, showing that mercy should be tempered with vigilance, especially when danger is near.\n",
